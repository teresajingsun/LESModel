Description
    Implementation of the minimum-dissipation model (QR).
    The QR model swithches off in laminar flow. Zero eddy viscosity at a no-slip wall. Negative values of the effective viscosity are removed by clipping it to
    zero. Backward energy cascade is closed.

Target platform
    The code is known to work with OpenFOAM/v2006, OpenFOAM/v2012, OpenFOAM/v2106, OpenFOAM/v2206.
    If the solver couldn't find the QR model, prefix the solver with the preload command.
