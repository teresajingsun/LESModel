#Target platform
    The code is known to work with OpenFOAM/v2006, OpenFOAM/v2012, OpenFOAM/v2106, OpenFOAM/v2206.
    If the solver couldn't find the QR model, prefix the solver with the preload command. The preload command for the pimpleFoam solver in v2206 version is as following:
	LD_PRELOAD="$HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-v2206/platforms/linux64GccDPInt32Opt/lib/libcompressibleTurbulenceModels.so $HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-v2206/platforms/linux64GccDPInt32Opt/lib/libincompressibleTurbulenceModels.so  $HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-v2206/platforms/linux64GccDPInt32Opt/lib/libturbulenceModelSchemes.so $HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-v2206/platforms/linux64GccDPInt32Opt/lib/libturbulenceModels.so" pimpleFoam
    The path $HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-v2206/ is where you installed the OpenFOAM.

#Usage
    Make sure that OpenFOAM v2206 is loaded into your environment. (The implementations in OpenFOAM v2006, v2012, and v2106 are the same as those in OpenFOAM v2206.)

Since the turbulence model classes are templated in OpenFOAM v2206, you must copy the entire turbulence model directory into the user directory, rather than only copying specific existing models as in previous versions, such as OpenFOAM 2.3.0. Therefore, some preparatory work is needed, as outlined below:
	mkdir -p $FOAM_RUN // Ensure that you have both a user directory and a run directory.
	foam
	cp -r --parents src/TurbulenceModels $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR
	cd $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR/src/TurbulenceModels

Locate all the Make directories, change the location of compiled files to the relevant user directory, and then compile the files.
	find . -name Make
	sed -i s/FOAM_LIBBIN/FOAM_USER_LIBBIN/g ./*/Make/files
	./Allwmake

Ensure that the following three new shared-object files are located in $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR/platforms/linux64GccDPInt32Opt/lib:
	libcompressibleTurbulenceModels.so
	libincompressibleTurbulenceModels.so
	libturbulenceModelSchemes.so
	libturbulenceModels.so

Copy the desired SGS model, such as the QR model, into the LES directory and complete all necessary processes for compilation:
	cd turbulenceModels/LES
	cp -r QR .

Then open the file turbulentTransportModels.C:
	cd $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR/src/TurbulenceModels
	vim incompressible/turbulentTransportModels/turbulentTransportModels.C

add the following lines:
	#include "QR.H"
	makeLESModel(QR);

under the lines for the Smagorinsky model:
	#include "Smagorinsky.H"
	makeLESModel(Smagorinsky);

Save and close the file, then update the lnInclude directory and compile:
	wmakeLnInclude turbulenceModels
	./Allwmake

Then update turbulentTransportModels.C and compile: 
	touch incompressible/turbulentTransportModels/turbulentTransportModels.C
	./Allwmake


#Test cases
     All test cases can be found in the "cases" directory, including a channel flow, periodic hills, a circular cylinder, and a wind turbine.

#Using minimum-dissipation models, for instance, the QR model, in your own OpenFOAM cases
    In the "constant/turbulentProperties" file, set the following:
	LES
	{
	    LESModel        QR;

	    QRCoeffs
	    {
		Ck          0.024;
	    }

	    turbulence      on;
	    printCoeffs     on;
	    delta           cubeRootVol;
	    cubeRootVolCoeffs
	    {
		deltaCoeff      1;
	    }
	}
